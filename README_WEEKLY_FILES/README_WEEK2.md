Fake Review Detection System — Week 2
📅 Week 2 — OCR Pipeline & Image Preprocessing

Goal: Extract review text reliably from screenshots or photos of product reviews and prepare it for ML models.

🔹 Day 8 — Image Collection

Collected 200–500 screenshot images of reviews from mobile and web templates.

To speed up the process, synthetic images were generated by rendering text into realistic mobile/web review templates.

Organized images into folders:

data/images/raw/
data/images/synthetic/

🔹 Day 9 — Preprocessing Implementation

Created src/ocr.py with preprocessing functions:

Grayscale conversion to reduce color noise.

Denoising to remove artifacts.

Thresholding to enhance text clarity for OCR.

Tested preprocessing functions on sample images to ensure clear text extraction.

🔹 Day 10 — OCR Integration

Integrated Tesseract OCR with preprocessing pipeline.

Converted images to text using:

from pytesseract import image_to_string


Verified output on sample images and adjusted preprocessing parameters to improve accuracy.

🔹 Day 11 — Data Cleaning & Formatting

Cleaned OCR-extracted text:

Removed unwanted characters, extra spaces, and line breaks.

Normalized text (lowercase, punctuation removal).

Ensured consistent format for all extracted reviews.

🔹 Day 12 — Data Structuring

Structured OCR text into tabular format:

Columns: review_id, product_id, review_text, source_image

Saved intermediate structured data as CSV for downstream ML processing.

🔹 Day 13 — Validation & Quality Check

Manually validated a sample of extracted reviews to ensure OCR accuracy.

Compared OCR output with original images and corrected preprocessing parameters as needed.

Ensured minimum errors and noise in the extracted text.

🔹 Day 14 — Checkpoint & Sample CSV

Produced a sample CSV from cleaned OCR data:

review_id | product_id | review_text | source_image


Confirmed all columns are correctly formatted.

Verified that data is ready for ML model input.

✅ Week 2 Summary

OCR pipeline implemented for review text extraction.

Images preprocessed for better OCR accuracy.

Cleaned and structured text data saved for ML training.

Sample CSV prepared as a checkpoint for Week 3 (ML model development).
